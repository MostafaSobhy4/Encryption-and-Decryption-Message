Welcome to the Encryption and Decryption Program, i made this C++ code to implements a simple encryption and decryption algorithm using a modified form of the Route Cipher . The program allows users to input a message, choose a secret key, and encrypt or decrypt the message based on their choice.  Route Cipher  is a transposition cipher that rearranges the characters of the message in a spiral pattern. The encryption function hides the message within a 2D array, and the decryption function reconstructs the original message.
